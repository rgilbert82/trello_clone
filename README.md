This is a single-page clone of trello.com that I made using Node.js, Express, Backbone, jQuery, jQuery UI, Handlebars, Jade and Stylus.

The drag & drop functionality was implemented using jQuery UI's draggable and sortable methods.

The app's content is generated dynamically, and the data for that content is stored in JSON files on the back end.
